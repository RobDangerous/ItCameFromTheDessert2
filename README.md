# It Came from the Dessert 2

Entry for [Ludum Dare 40](http://ldjam.com/) and the topic "The more you have, the worse it is".

This is a successor to our previous game, where giant ants came out of the cake. 

## How to play:
Look around the kitchen with your mouse. Move around with WASD. Do not look in the kitchen cupboards. There can be a nasty surprise waiting for you.

## Creadits:
* Programming: Robert Konrad and Polona Caserman
* Graphics: Maja Nadvesnik
